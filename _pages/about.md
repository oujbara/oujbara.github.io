About me
=======
Ph.D. candidate in neuroscience blending applied mathematics with dynamical systems at  <a href="https://lmah.univ-lehavre.fr/">LMAH</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://lmah.univ-lehavre.fr/~ambrosio/"> Pr. Ambrosio Benjamin</a> and <a href="https://lmah.univ-lehavre.fr/~alaoui/">Pr. Aziz Alaoui </a>. My research investigates brain dynamics through mathematical modeling, focusing on emotional processing mechanisms and fear circuits. I combine dynamical systems theory with neuroscience to understand complex neural networks and their behaviors, bridging the gap between theoretical mathematics and neurobiological applications.
